# SSW567 HW05 Static Code Analysis

# Summary
It was very time consuming (First Time) & very easy to use testing tool I used to build my scripts according pycharm community edition & it's py lint which was very helpful.
When I googled about code coverage in pycharm they had it only on professional version so I had to install professional version pycharm edition for this assignment.
after that I checked my code coverage which was above 80% that was required for this assignment but mine was 91% TestTriangle.py & 88% Triangle.py. Then I tried to figure out all the issues
& I successfully done both files 100% coverage.

## 1.	The GitHub URL containing the code that was analyzed is here...
https://github.com/konglingwengit/Triangle567/tree/StaticCodeAnalysis

## 2. I used pycharm community version for static code analyzer tool.

3. I used pycharm Professional version for code coverage tool.

4. I had to add new test case for coverage of 100%

Here is the OLD test cases screenshot.

Here is the New added test case.

5.	Here are the Results

Static code analysis: Without Code Coverage Test I couldn't been able to spot some code coverage of my tests of Not a Triangle with in range.

Here screenshot after fixed Code Coverage by adding new tests & fixing code of main function call which I commented out.
